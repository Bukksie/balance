0.1.1
==================
### Bug Fixes
- Fix (and simplify) balanceDF.plot to organize the order of groups (now unadjusted/self is left, adjusted/self center, and target is on the right)
- Fix plotly functions to use the red color for self when only compared to target (since in that case it is likely unadjusted): balance.stats_and_plots.weighted_comparisons_plots.plotly_plot_qq and balance.stats_and_plots.weighted_comparisons_plots.plotly_plot_bar


0.1.0 (2022-11-20)
==================
### Summary
- balance released to the world!
